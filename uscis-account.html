	<!-- overview -->
		
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Problem Context</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
			Based on the research of user interviews, my team realized that the users of USCIS website are in need of a personalized account experience where users can easily find, apply, and track their USCIS benefits in one place. Therefore, we worked on the USCIS account experience in tandem of developing the online N-400 form and other collaterals.

	<!-- project goals -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Project goals</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		Our team want to accomplish this project with several goals in mind: 
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Some times, it is difficult for users to find information on uscis.gov. The account experience is intended to help users quickly locate the benefits available to them.</li>
				<li>Users are nervous about the English and civics test, and they do not want to waste their money. The account experience will prepare users for the application process they are about to undertake in order to prevent unnecessary costly mistakes.</li>
				<li>Users are unaware of their application status; it feels like a black box. Therefore, the account experience will be designed to clarify the process and status after an application is submitted. </li>
				<li>Build a minimum viable product (MVP) to test and iterate on.</li>
				<li>Practice lean UX by collecting maximum amount of validated learning about our customers with the least effort.</li>
				<li>Build a simple, clean interface.</li>
				<li>Create a framework for other benefits to fit into.</li>
				<li>Flexible design to accommodate for changing customer needs and requirements.</li>
				<li>Iterate quickly based on qualitative and quantitative feedback.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	<div class="body">
		<p class="portfoliop">
		To optimize the account experience design, we constantly ask ourselves three questions during the design process: Does this design convey the tone of USCIS, which is encapsulated in three words: welcoming, clear, and secure? What are we not considering in this design? Are there places we can simplify the design?

		</p>
	</div>


	<!-- Ideate sketches-->	
	<div class="body">
		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Ideate</h3>
		<p class="portfoliop">
			During the ideation phase of the project, our team worked with various stakeholders, including adjudicators, plain language strategist, lawyers and clients from USCIS to conduct design studio. By doing time-boxed ideation exercises, we created more than two hundred preliminary ideas about the account experience. The team again went through several rounds of formal critique and iteration after the design studio exercise to map out different options before deciding on a final direction to implement the account experience design.

	<div class="body">
		<p class="portfolioh3">User flows</p>
		<p class="portfoliop">
			Based on the requirements produced by previous research and design studio, our team created four user flows to design the wireframes on.

	<!-- Design critique -->

	<div class="body">
		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Design critique</h3>
		<p class="portfoliopless">My team also performed design critique on a regular basis. The purpose of the collaboration efforts is to bring the broader design team, spanning USCIS, Excella Consulting, and 18F, to come up with the final design prototypes for the various design tasks. We hold several design studio exercises to map out different options before picking a final direction. Then, the design work would go through several rounds of formal critique and iteration to be optimized for the usability testing.</p>
	</div>


	<!-- Usability testing -->


	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Usability testing</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">After rounds of iteration and design critique, our team developed a prototype for usability testing.</p>
		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Research goals</h3>
		<p class="portfoliopless">The goals of the research are to investigate the following:
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Validate that the account experience conveys an appropriate feelings for the user.</li>
			<li>Determine preferences between two distinct visual designs for the account experience landing page.</li> 
			<li>Validate the navigation ease of use and obviousness.</li>
			<li>Validate the clarity and helpfulness of information in a user’s case timeline.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">Given the tight timeline, guerilla usability interviews and A/B testing on visual preference techniques were used to ensure the proposed designs meet user needs and expectations. My team went to the USCIS field office in Baltimore, Maryland to perform the usability testing.</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">The areas for product research fall into the following areas:
			<ul class="list">

				<li>Design validation: what visual design resonates with users?</li>
				<li>Problem validation: what problems exist with the proposed solution?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		“[On uscis.gov] you don’t know where to look.” I use Google because “it takes 5 or 10 minutes to find what you need, not even including [time spent] reading what you need.”</p>

		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Key findings</h3>
		<p class="portfoliopless">The purpose of usability testing is to collect qualitative feedback to guide and validate our design decisions. We began usability testing on the account experience at the Baltimore field office, conducting visual preference testing on the account homepage and usability testing on the case status flow. </p>


		<p class="portfoliopless"><u>Visual preference testing</u></p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
			<ul class="list">
				<li><b>Users are focused on the big picture:</b>
				generally, most people don’t notice the small design changes. Only 1 or 2 users noticed the font and icon differences. Most of the focus was on the images and the titles/text. Users responded positively to the 28-day countdown. </li>

				<li><b>The idea of America conveys security:</b> 
				the seal, government logo and flag in the universal navigation do a good job of conveying security. More surprising was how many users said that the page gave them the feeling of security “because it is America”, meaning they trust the American government to be secure. </li>

				<li><b>Colorful, strong images get positive responses:</b>
				nearly every user responded positively to the Statue of Liberty image, indicating that emotional and historical symbols of immigration remain important to our customers.</li>

				<li><b>Images of people need to be genuine:</b> 
				users responded positively to the picture of the naturalization ceremony on the homepage, multiple users mentioned the diversity and feeling of the photo. Contrastingly, one user joked of the photo of the single smiling Asian man “I don’t know what he is trying to sell me”</li>

				<li><b>Clear content helps direct users’ attention:</b> 
				most users choose clear as one of the words in the product reaction test. One user noted that the homepage felt very differently from what exists now where she felt overwhelmed by options of where to go, where to direct information (especially on government pages that have a sidebar with a lot of links).</li>

		<u>Usability testing for N-400 case flow</u>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Navigating via the timeline was not immediately clear. Only around half the people seemed to get the navigation (through the timeline) immediately and the other half either didn’t know or seemed hesitant to click. </li>

			<li>When users scrolled down the page, more often than not they clicked the links with the ">" symbol. </li>

			<li>The users we tested with were very familiar with the naturalization process.
			Many users already knew the steps in the naturalization process so had a point of reference for the timeline (because they just finished their naturalization interview). </li>

			<li>Transparency is key to easing the naturalization process and easing stress.
			The information within the cards would have been helpful to our users if they had it during their naturalization processes. Most said they appreciated the transparency into the process because they didn’t have a clear idea of what was going on with their application. </li>
			<li>Users that had tracked their applications online expressed frustration at the current service because all it said was that their application was in progress. This is one of our biggest opportunities to reduce stress around the application process. Can also alleviate stress around misplacing letters / information USCIS sends them. </li>
