		<p class="portfoliopem"><b>Team:</b> Yue Xu, Dana Daniels, Suganya Sankaran</p>

<!-- Problem context -->
		
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Background information</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">For small independent business owners that are bothered by the unfair advantage of large corporate competitors, Fypus empowers these owners to aggregate purchases to reach economies of scale and level the playing field via an application.</p>
		<p class="portfoliop">Unlike anonymous, traditional group purchasing organizations that only focus on one particular industry or indirect cost, Fypus provides the platform to ally small business owners with their network of business-owning colleagues they already know and trust to source from their network of suppliers that are already known and trusted.</p>
		<p class="portfoliop">Fypus was seeking help from the Cornell team to create an application of a purchasing platform that allows businesses to group their supplies together and makes joining together as easy as Facebook group. Partnered businesses have the opportunity to group as many supplies as necessary and can source from whatever supplier decided upon. Fypus would aggregate their purchases and allow each self-selected group to send the total amount to any agreed upon supplier.</p>

<!-- Work breakdown structure -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Work breakdown structure</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">Once my team received all the requirements from the client, we divided the work into tasks and created a work breakdown structure for the project. We have a team of three people, with two specializing in UX/UI design and front-end development, and one specializing in back-end development.</p>

<!-- Information architecture -->

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Information architecture</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">After we received the preliminary wireframes from the client, we created an information architecture to determine which pages need wireframes as well as questions we had on the wireframes.</p>

<!-- Heuristic evaluation -->
	<div class="body">
		<p class="caption">Information architecture for Fypus application.</p>
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Heuristic evaluation</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">We also performed a heuristic evaluation on the preliminary wireframes client provided. The goal of the evaluation was to identify potential issues and explore possible ways to fix them in early stage.</p>

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Wireframe/userflows</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">Based on the wireframes client provided and the heuristic evaluation, our team modified and enhanced 4 user flows that were to be completed as minimum viable product (MVP).</p>

<!-- Usability testing -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Usability testing</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		Because of the time constraint of the project, we only had time to conduct one round of usability testing on 3 participants and had some key findings:

		<ul class="list">
			<li>On the "join" page, there is no information about why one should join Fypus and its benefit.</li>
			<li>When type in items to purchase, users wanted to see a drop down menu and type ahead with items suggestions for them to find items more easily.</li>
			<li>There should be a confirmation page with all the info user put in once he/she finish recruiting member.</li>
			<li>Need instruction on what “create new league” means.</li>
			<li>One user suggested that on the invitation email sent by Fypus, besides an introduction about Fypus, it might be helpful to include a survey on what items the user is interested in purchasing, and then connect the user with people who has purchased the same item. (Backlog)</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<hr>
		<p class="portfolio-quote">
			"It's a very interesting application, like Facebook or other kinds of social media for small businesses."
		</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="portfoliop">
			We then drafted an usability testing plan for the client to conduct on the design after my team rolls off the project.</p>
			<p class="portfoliopless">
			The usability test objectives are:
			<ul class="list">
				<li>To identify design inconsistencies and usability issues within the user interface, the content and the information architecture.</li>
				<li>Exercise the application under controlled test conditions with users. Collected data will be used to evaluate the usability goals of having an effective, efficient, and satisfying purchasing platform for small business owners.</li>
				<li>Establish baseline user performance and user-satisfaction levels of the user interface for future usability evaluations.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">Potential users should include small business owners who are making purchases of supplies by using modern technologies, such as website or app. At least 5 subjects should be participating in this study.</p>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			Usability Tasks:
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Task 1: Request to join Fypus</li>
			<li>Task 2: Create a new league</li>
			<li>Task 3: Recruit members</li>
			<li>Task 4: Check the latest notifications</li>
			<li>Task 5: Check your leagues</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
			Questionnaires:
			<ol class="list">
			<li>General feedback on the app</li>
			<li>What are some pain points when completing the task?</li>
			<li>Where did the user get stuck?</li>
			</ol>
			</p>

<!-- Front-end development -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Front-end development</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">We used HTML/CSS and JavaScript to develop an interactive prototype for usability testing and client's review. Our back-end developer used Django for the back-end development and deployed the site on Heroku.</p>
