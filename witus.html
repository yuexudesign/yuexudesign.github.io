	<!-- Problem Context -->
		
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Problem Context</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
			In 2016, there were about <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/international-student-applications-drop-at-us-colleges/3780657.html" target="_blank">1.2 million international students</a> attending colleges and universities in the U.S. Due to information gap, many international students face considerable confusions with various issues critical to living in the U.S. For some of those issues, such as work authorization, necessary information is sometimes nonexistent. Even when the information is accessible, it is oftentimes difficult to comprehend. Information is the most important resource in this digital age, such insufficiency puts international students at a disadvantage, leading to the loss of opportunities when they are as qualified as their peers. Through this project, my team hopes to provide international students better access to comprehensible information needed to thrive in the U.S. and eventually help them fully realize their potentials.

	<div class="body">
		<!-- <h3 class="portfolioh3">Goals</h3>
		<p class="portfoliop">
		To have a better understanding of our users, we conducted contextual interviews. The goals of our contextual interview were to: see whether other international students actually encounter confusion about working authorization in the U.S.; dig deeper by asking about past experiences - both successes and failures; and obtain insights they might have regarding this issue. If the participants have similar issue, we then hoped to learn about which specific aspects of living in the U.S. are most confusing and would be significantly beneficial if pertinent information were more easily accessible and understandable. Finally, we would like to obtain insights they might have regarding this issue. 
		</p> -->
		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Contextual Interview</h3>
		<p class="portfoliop">The goal for this project is to design a product to help international students overcome obstacles they encounter while studying and living in the States. It was crucial to do user research on international students to find out what their pain points and needs are. Our investigative process started with recruiting international students who were planning to work in the U.S. or were already actively seeking full time jobs in the U.S. My team prepared script for the interview protocol and the consent forms. We recruited 10 participants to conduct the interview.  </p>

		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Affinity diagram</h3>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		After the interview study, we validated our assumption on that job search and work authorization is one of the most significant problems for many international students in the U.S., and this issue is greatly due to information gap. We also found that social life presented a problem space. The job search and work authorization issue is complex and significant enough, the social life issue may be too much of a complex issue to investigate within this project scope. Therefore, our team decided to focus our time and effort on exploring the problem space of job-related issues in the U.S.
		</p>
		<p class="portfoliop"> We unpacked all 10 interview notes and collected 123 data points. We then categorized the data points and mapped them into an affinity diagram. </p>

		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Key Findings</h3>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			<ul class="list">
			<!-- <li>Our participants were from different demographics and background, and most of them want to stay in the U.S. to work upon graduation.</li> -->

			<li>Participants had a basic understanding of how the work authorization process works in the U.S. and the corresponding requirements, but they were not fully aware of the details.</li>

			<li>Some participants seemed frustrated about the technical terms (e.g. E-verify, OPT, visa sponsorship). The level of confidence about the technical terms was relatively low.</li>

			<li>Some participants assumed that all big companies sponsor visas and are also E-verified, which is not true.</li>

			<li>Most participants would obtain information about OPT and E-Verify from other people (e.g. friend, alumni, lawyer). They also found it was difficult to find understandable information on the details of work authorization in the U.S. (e.g. E-Verify). </li>

			<li>Participants felt frustrated and insecure because there is no easy way to find out whether a company is E-Verified. Most of participants thought current job-searching platforms are lacking in “international-student-friendly” resources.</li>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
		We drafted some initial requirements for the system we were about to design after we grasped a better understanding of the problem context by unpacking the interview notes and creating the affinity diagram and flow model. With our system, the international students should be able to find:
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Easily understandable information on work authorization (CTP, OPT, E-Verify, H-1B visa) in the U.S., and clear explanations of job-related requirements by reframing and visualizing the information.</li>
				<li>An up-to-date and reliable list of U.S. employers who are willing to sponsor international students for work visa.</li>
				<li>A list of jobs that are currently open for application with information on sponsorship highlighted.</li>
				<li>Most current and reliable list of U.S. employers who participate in the E-Verify program.</li>
				<li>A list of all events that are relevant to job-searching. The students shall be able to find details about all the career-related and networking events being organized on-campus.</li>
				<li>Mentorship or peer-to-peer guidance.</li>

		<!-- Paper prototyping -->

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Paper prototyping</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
			Once we fleshed out some user scenarios, our team envisioned a website to assist international students with job searching process and clarify certain processes and terminologies about work authorization. This website is comprised of five parts, including job listing page and description page, company listing page and description page, work authorization training page, Q &amp A page, and the job-pinning functionality. We then built paper prototype incorporating all major functionalities to conduct usability testing.

	<!-- Testing -->

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Testing</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			We recruited three international students who were actively looking for jobs and asked the users to look at the animated movie of our paper prototype that illustrates the main functions step-by-step and to think out loud their confusions or comments on any of the features. Below are some key findings:</p>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			
			<ul class="list">
			<li>The knowledge of the job authorization requirements is critical to the understanding of our design. Therefore, we want to incorporate the educational information during the onboarding process.</li>

			<li>The sponsorship and E-verify information caused a lot of confusions for our users. Consequently, we want to improve the way we display the E-verify and sponsorship information and also rethink the method of crowdsourcing that information.</li>

			<li>Users showed little enthusiasm on the job posting page and company information page because of the similarity it possesses compared to existing solutions, but the pinning functionality was the highlight for all users. They appreciated the idea to be able to have a place to put all the job listings that they are following.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

 		<p class="portfoliop">
			 Since our system is specially designed with international students’ needs in mind, we wanted to find a way to strengthen the aspect of providing job authorization information to differentiate our design from other job searching platform. Because the pinning functionality was the most well-received feature among our users, we wanted to emphasis it. <em>We made a pivot on the design to accommodate our new findings by highlighting the pinning functionality based on the feedbacks we received.</em>

	<h2 class="portfolioh2">Iterating</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">The team iterated on the design focusing on the web extension and job pinning functionality. We then created low-fidelity Balsamiq prototype for another round of usability testing. The Balsamiq prototype is designed for the following primary tasks:
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Get education on U.S. work authorization during onboarding.</li>
			<li>Directly check the company’s E-Verify status in the browser extension.</li>
			<li>Vote for company’s E-Verify status from the browser extension.</li> 
			<li>See sponsorship information and pin a job from other websites to the user’s personal portal and public board on our platform.</li>
			<li>Organize pinned jobs collected from other websites (Handshake, Glassdoor, company website, etc.)

			To self evaluate our design, the team conducted a heuristic evaluation based on <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">Nielsen Norman's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</a>. We collected 57 entries of potential issues.

		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Design critique</h3>
		<p class="portfoliop">
		During the design critique session, we received more positive feedback on the pinning functionality from our peers. This reassured our idea of changing the design to focus more on the web browser extension and job pinning functionality.
		 
		We assumed that there would be few job pinnings at the beginning, but the number would gradually increase due to the crowdsourcing nature of the design. By having our users, who are mostly international students, generate all the postings on our public board, we hope to see a pool of jobs that better fits international students’ job-searching needs.

	</div>

	<!-- usability testing -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Usability testing</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			We conducted another rounds of usability testing to validate some assumptions about the new design approach. We wanted to check if the users can do the following: 
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Understand educational information about work authorization</li>
			<li>Find reliable information on company's E-verify status and visa sponsorship status</li>
			<li>Pin job posting to personal and public job boards</li>
			<li>Organize job postings on personal board</li>
			<li>Provide comments for a specific company</li>

<!-- 	<div class="body">

		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Tasks /Activities</h3>
		<p class="portfoliop">
		1. Sign up in the system to receive welcoming education information, find where to access the educational information later. This task will evaluate whether users can find understandable information on job authorization.
		2. Check the E-Verify status of a company in the extension, contribute their own comment on the  E-Verify status on the company, and see other people’s comments. This task will test whether the user can  find an up-to-date and reliable information on which employers participate in the E-Verify program, and also whether can easily provide comments on whether certain companies are E-Verified.
		3. Pin a job that sponsors employee in their own job board, and also make it available in the public board. This task will test whether the users can pin job postings to My Board and the Public Job Board, and whether they can access job sponsorship availability.
		4. Organize the jobs in “My Board” by creating a new folder and put the Google job posting in the folder, and also delete the Google job posting from their board. This task would verify whether the users can organize job postings in their job board.</p>
