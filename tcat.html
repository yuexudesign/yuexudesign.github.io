		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Background:</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit Inc. was seeking help from Cornell team to increase ridership and revenue. The TCAT team had an assumption that many riders were not well-informed of real-time bus information; therefore, by displaying real-time bus info on a digital interface would encourage more ridership. The Cornell team was tasked to validate their assumption, and collaborate with system engineers, urban planners and designers to help TCAT design a system to improve the bus service. The team is divided into three sub teams to focus on a specific area. My team focused on employing design thinking to explore potential ways to display real-time bus info at local businesses as well as improving riders’ experience by understanding their needs.</p>


		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Challenge:</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			Our challenge was to redesign the mobility system in Ithaca, so as to set a new standard of sustainability in upstate NY.
			To fully understand the challenge, we listed several questions that need to be answered:
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Is a real-time bus information interface the right solution to solve the problem?</li>
				<li>Do customers want the digital display?</li>
				<li>What’s the value proposition for the businesses?</li>
				<li>Cost/benefit: is the display worth the money and effort?</li>
				<li>Design: if we were to implement a design of information interface, what will it look like?</li>
				<li>Location: where are we going to put the real-time info display?</li>
				<li>What businesses are out there that can provide more ridership?</li>
			</ul>

	<!-- Empathize -->

	<div class="body">
			<h2 class="portfolioh2">Empathize</h2>
			<p class="portfoliopless">
				What is the system we are trying to design? The actual start was: framing the complex challenge. We needed to explore the problem space by conduct empathy fieldwork and interact with the users personally to get first-hand information. We should be designing interactions by:
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Immerse (1st person): experience what our users experience.</li>
					<li>Engage (2nd person): interview users.</li>
					<li>Observe (3rd person): view users in context.</li>
					
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="portfoliopless">
				The goal of empathy field work is to understand users’ needs and emotions during different stages interacting with the bus system. We used the ridership data provided by TCAT to identify five places around the city to conduct the empathy fieldwork. We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik" target="_blank">Robert Plutchik’s emotion wheel</a> to assist us understanding the emotion of users.</p>

			<p class="portfoliopless">
				We wanted to experience what our users are experiencing, so we started empathy fieldwork by immerse ourselves in the bus system. We prepared a scenario where we were first-time visitors in the city who were trying to go to the shopping center. We took detailed notes on problems we encountered, things we enjoyed, our emotions, and the entire experience about riding the bus as if we were the real users. Then, we went to different places near the bus stop to observe users in context, and how they interact with the environment. We noted both the normal and the unusual of “what”, “how”, and their emotions. Finally, we engaged with different user groups by interviewing the riders and the business owners.
				<!-- m. Some questions we asked the users:
				<ul class="list">
					<li>“Can you tell us about your day yesterday, from the time you left home to the time you returned home?”</li>
					<li>“What did you do last weekend?”</li>
					<li>“What is the most fun experience in Ithaca with your friends/family that you can remember? Tell me all the details from the time you left home.”</li>
					<li>“Can you tell us about the last time you took a bus…we want to hear the whole story.”</li>
					<li>“Can you tell us about the last time you were really relaxed/stressed out while commuting to work? Take me through that moment.”</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p class="portfoliopless">
				Some questions we asked the business owners:
				<ul class="list">
					<li>“How do your customers come to your business?”</li>
					<li>“What is the demographic of customers at your business?”</li>
					<li>“What is a potential group of people you'd like to bring to your business?”</li>
					<li>“Where is the nearest bus stop to your business?”</li>
					<li>“How will a better city mobility system affect your business?”</li>
				</ul> -->
			</p>

			<p class="portfoliop">
				The scope of the interview is to understand how the users are using the mobility system (to come to Ithaca and to move around Tompkins County) and what their needs are. We conducted several rounds of empathy fieldwork and interviewed 12 users and 5 business owners. We started with some broad questions and encouraged the user to tell their stories. Then, we were able to narrow down to the specific subject toward the end according to what the uses were telling us. We also frequently asked about emotions (“How did you feel about that?”) and “why” to dig deeper into the story. We found that mostly locals or people who have been here for a very long time (more than 2-3 years) thought TCAT was reliable and had great service, but to people who were new to Ithaca, TCAT was confusing.

		<p class="portfoliop">In order to define the right question(s) to answer, the team unpacked and quantified the notes from over 30 immersion, observation and interview sessions, and we translated the empathy fieldwork into hundreds of “emotional” data. We discussed and labeled insights, needs, and surprises on different colored sticky notes for each session. A total of 178 needs/insights/surprises were collected and sorted in categories and subcategories. These data points were then made into an affinity diagram. We also connected the data points whenever we found tension, contradiction, consistency, synergy or uncertainty amongst them.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">In order to address the complexity of the system and capture the “big picture”, systems tools (like context and capabilities diagrams) were built. The goal of the Overarching Context Diagram was to visualize in a single shot all the POVs. We want to analyze how stakeholders interact and benefit from the mobility system, and to establish key connections that needed to be fostered among stakeholders. For example, Cornell students want to use the system to find businesses, local businesses are willing to sponsor the system. In other words, they wanted a mobility system able to create a sense of community and receive reciprocal benefits.</p>

The capabilities diagram summarizes the key findings from the data unpacking stage, and it defines the core values the system provides for riders and local businesses.</p>

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Prototype</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">After the brainstorm sessions, we translated the top ideas into a potential solution: a digital kiosk display at landmark areas and frequently visited places. It consists of three main parts: real-time information, business information, and community information. The kiosk displays real-time bus information when user touches the bus stop button on screen. On the other side of the kiosk, another screen displays information regarding local businesses and events to promote local businesses and the bond of the community. There is also a printer for people to print out promotional information, such as coupons and event information, to bring with them and share with friends.</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">After we created the paper prototypes, we brought them to the actual sites (landmarks and business center) where we intended to install the display for usability testing. We interviewed eight users and summarized the key findings:

			<ul class="list">
				<li>The way that time and station information is displayed seemed confusing to four users. They did not fully understand what the two numbers under "MIN" represent.</li>
				<li>Because of the shrinked scale and the paper built, three users did not realize they can interact with the screen. It was after a guidance, they then realized it was a digital kiosk.</li>
				<li>One user indicated that she wants to know how long it would take her to get to her destination.</li>
				<li>One user noticed the business logos on the bus stop map. He fully understood the intention of the kiosk, and provided some positive feedback.</li>
			</ul>

		<p class="portfoliop">Below is a concept of the high-fidelity prototype of the digital display. On one side of the kiosk, user can touch the bus stop button on screen to retrieve real-time bus information for that particular bus stop. Businesses who sponsor the bus information display will have their businesses labeled on the map for users to explore. On the other side of the kiosk, a screen displays advertisement of local businesses and events on a rolling basis. If interested, user can press the “PRINT” button to print ticket of events and promos seen on the screen.</p>

<!-- Business model -->

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Moving forward</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">The business model for our concept is through subscription. Businesses can subscibe to the digital display service monthly, which includes a digital advertisement and printed coupons. The advertising slot runs 24/7 on a rolling basis, and users can print up to 18,000 coupons. The value proposition for local businesses is that they pay a small amount of monthly subscription fee to bring more exposure to their businesses. The value proposition for TCAT is by using this model, the company will recieve a revenue through subscriptions from local businesses, and the easily accessible bus information will encourage more ridership. Moreover, by displaying local events and activities, our concept also serves as a means to promote community bond amongst people in Ithaca.</p>

		
		<!-- <p class="portfoliop">The other two subteams also created multiple collaterals to contribute to the bus system for it to realize its capabilities. Here is a list of the outcomes:</p>
		
		<p class="portfoliop">
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Modular signage with LED dot matrix for real-time arrival updates in high-traffic stations</li>
				<li>Social Media: TCAT Twitter account for emergency updates, route changes, entertainment</li>
				<li>Paper Welcome Packet: Initiates the new user, includes etiquette</li>
				<li>Reflective bus passes for flagging in rural areas</li>
				<li>Park and Ride Signs</li>
				<li>Lansing District Re-Route</li>
				<li>New Maps</li>
			</ul>
