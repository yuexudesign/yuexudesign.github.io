	<!-- overview -->
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Project background</h2>
		
			<p class="portfoliop">
			USCIS has a monumental mission: to protect and promote the American dream. Each year the agency helps over 14 million people around the world by providing information, facilitating immigration to the U.S., and promoting understanding of citizenship. For years this process relied on a complicated system of forms and phone calls, leading to huge backlogs for USCIS staff and frustration for their customers.</p>
			<p class="portfoliop">
			USCIS envisioned an integrated online experience that simplified and streamlined the process for their customers. A team of innovators from both industry and government was formed, including my team from Excella Consulting, 18F, and the U.S. Digital Service to turn this dream into reality. As a part of Excella’s agile engineering team, we worked side-by-side with the customers and the USCIS client to design and deploy a solution that is accessible, informative, and highly personal – providing a digital gateway for the next generation of Americans and changing the face of government IT.</p>


		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Problem definition</h2>

		<!-- myUSCIS: Vision, Mission, Goals -->  

			<p class="portfoliopless">Our team consists a collaborative effort of UX designers, visual designers, content strategists, plain language specialists, software engineers, business analysts, project managers, and product owner. We conducted design sprints to answer critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Our team practiced principles from Lean UX and IDEO’s Design Thinking to gain customer insights and reduce risks through testing.</p>
<!-- 		<a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank">5-day design sprint</a>.-->
			<p class="portfoliop"> First, the collaborative team focused on understanding the context of the problem. There’s anecdotal evidence that many people who file for naturalization select the “wrong” basis for eligibility. This often winds up resulting in longer processing times, and, in some cases, more expensive fees. From the customers’ end, they are usually unaware that there is more than one path to becoming a naturalized citizen. If the applicants fill out the wrong form or select the wrong basis for eligibility, it creates a burden both for the applicant as well as adjudicators. My team conceptualized the eligibility tool, which is intended as the lead-in/companion for the form N-400 (naturalization application) customer experience and the rest of the journey to becoming a U.S. citizen.
			</p>

			<p class="portfoliopless">We conducted the product research by constantly asking questions in the following areas:
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Problem Validation: What problems exist with the proposed solution?</li>
					<li>Customer Validation: Who has this problem? What are their needs, motivations?</li>
					<li>Solution Validation: How can the design be iterated to avoid these problems?</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

	</div>


	<!-- Analytics -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2"> Analytics</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
			We studied the quantitative data presented by the USCIS statistician, Eric Cohen, and compared the major metrics captured by Google Analytics about mobile and desktop distribution of USCIS website usage, average time spent on filing N-400, browser usage distribution, and N-400 applicant age, etc.
		</p>
	</div>

<!-- 	<div class="aboutme">

	</div>  -->

	<!-- Competitive research-->
	<div class="body">
		<!-- <p class="caption">Some information we studied during the phase of understanding the problem space.</p> -->
 		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Competitive Research:</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			We also conducted research on what existing products are trying to solve the problem by being more informative to users during each step of the user journey.
			<ul class="list">
				<li><a href="https://www.citizenshipworks.org/info/naturalization" target="_blank">Citizenshipworks </a></li>
				<li><a href ="https://www.gov.uk/becoming-a-british-citizen/check-if-you-can-apply" target="_blank">Become a British citizen</a></li>
				<li><a href ="https://online.immi.gov.au/lusc/login" target="_blank">Australian immigration service</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=132" target="_blank">Becoming a Singapore Citizen</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.commonapp.org/" target="_blank">The Common Application</a></li>
			</ul>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
			After a thorough competitive analysis, we summarized a few key findings:
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Who has the best practice?
			Singapore's immigrration service is streamlined. All the information is written in plain language, and there is no question left to interpretation. The service also provides a digital application form. </li>
			<li>Who has service that is the easiest to use? Australia has an easy system. The system is highly defined with immediate accountability. There is more one-to-one interaction between the applicant and the adjudicating officer. </li>
			<li>In addition, UK also allows anyone (applicant or attorney) to access an online application. The form of the application is dynamic. For instance, if applicant is not married, no more questions on marriage will be asked. In contrast, the paper form N-400 from USCIS is too lengthy.</li>
			</ul>

		</p>
	</div>



	<!-- interviews -->

	<div class="body">
		
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Interviews</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
			To further understand the context and the problem, we formed a few subteams and conducted nine interviews with different user groups, including applicants, attorneys, ajudicators, and social workers who help low income people applying for citizenship.</p>

		<hr>

		<p class="portfolio-quote">	"The form is an extension of the English exam.”</p>

		<hr>


		<p class="portfoliopless">Key findings:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<!-- <li>Sometimes applicants file too soon.</li> -->
			<li>The main issue for the applicant may be a language barrier (writing and reading). Elder applicants who struggle with English will take more time to complete application.
			<li>Sometimes forms are very confusing to applicants. If they answer some questions wrong, they may face tremendous consequence. For instance, their green card can be at risk. The forms need to be more user-friendly.
			<li>Interview is long and stressful. English and civic tests have tremendous pressure on users. 
			<li>The cost to apply for citizenship is expensive, which can be an enormous burden on the applicant, i.e., application fee, workshop fee, time, travel, etc.</li>
			<li>The actual requirement on residency can be cumbersome. The attorney has to look at passport and figure out the dates to make sure the applicants are eligible. Some other screening issues are cumbersome, such as 5 years residency, previous employers, and addresses.
			<!-- <li>The security screening section can be lengthy and embarrassing. For instance, the applicants are asked if they are Nazi, Communist party, or prostitute, and they need to disclose membership in certain organization.</li> -->
			<li>Mobile is the only means to access the internet for the demographics some social workers serve.</li>
			<li>It would be a tremendous help if the applicant can have reassurance by getting communication directly from the government. It’s about trust. The official letter from government to the applicants can lower anxiety and reduce calls to USCIS’ customer service center.</li>
			<!-- <li>Attorneys are hesitant to have their clients to be the first one to test online submission. They want to make sure the system is tested and trustworthy. They are hesitant to use the online service until they are comfortable with the security of the system. -->
			<li>Anotehr barrier is that some appliants have little to no internet access.	
		</ul>
		</p>

	</div>


	<!-- Assumption and validation -->

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Hypothesis and validation</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
			After the team grasped the basic understanding of the problem space through the quantative analytics, competitive researches, and interviews, we generated a series of validations to the hypothesis we formed earlier.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">We captured the issues that are relevant to selecting the basis for eligibility, and we determined which ones have been validated (qualitatively, quantitatively, or both) and which ones are assumptions.</p>
		<p class="portfoliopless"> Factors (valid) affecting applicants for citizenship include:</p>
			<ul class="list">
			<li>People don’t read online.</li>
			<li>Comprehensibility is a problem.</li>
			<li>Applicants are not the expert. They do not often understand the eligibility choices they are asked to select at the beginning. For instance, an adjudicator we interviewed estimated 1-2 out of 12 applications has an eligibility-related issue on a given day.</li>
			<li>Applicants are unaware of the problem; there is a lack of applicant education.</li>
			<li>Form fields at times do not allow applicants to fill out information accurately (e.g., different socio-cultural naming conventions).</li>
			<li>Increasing number of people are using smartphones as their primary/only internet access. More than 40% users prefer to use mobile.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Ideate</h2>
		<h3 class="portfolioh3">First Ideation Phase</h3>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
			The team participated in a design studio to generate ideas. First, we reviewed the problem context and the known factors from the previous research. We then voted on which problem we wanted to dig into first and landed on:
			<ol class="list">
				<li><b>Determine Eligibility: </b>Help applicants know they are eligible and what their basis for eligibility is? How might we alleviate eligibility-based problems for applicants?</li>
				<li><b>User Journey: </b>Help applicants know what to expect. How might we give them a personalized experience of their journey?</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
			
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			We did a few rounds of sketching for each of the two areas above. Themes/patterns that emerged from the sketches:
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Mobile/Touch interactions (vs. desktop)</li>
				<li>Customer journey (i.e., where am I in the journey? sense of progress)</li>
				<li>Use artifacts, social APIs and existing customer dataset to reduce manual data entry</li>
				<li>Winnowing: moving from general to specific</li>
				<li>One step at a time (Tinder)</li>
				<li>Preparation/Checklist</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
			
		<!-- <p class="portfoliopless">
		Assumptions/Questions we noted from the sketches:

			<ul class="list">
			<li>Customer wants low-effort investment to get an answer</li>
			<li>Are customers willing to use social media APIs as a way to extract info (instead of manually entering data)?</li>
			<li>We assume that the customer has at least an 11<sup>th</sup>-grade literacy level</li>
			<li>Customer has access to a desktop computer or modern devices</li>
			<li>Customer has sufficient bandwidth</li>
			<li>Customer expects information (from government) to be up-to-date and accurate</li>
			<li>Customer knows their goal (“what benefit they’re seeking”)</li>

		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Second Ideation Phase</h3>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
			We reviewed previously created sketches, looked for common themes and identified conflicting ideas. In addition, we voted and narrowed down choices, and defined assumptions and validation methods. Then, the team created storyboards and sketched out the user story, and continued analyzing the sketches and whittled them down to a handful of ideas:</p>
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Mobile/Touch interactions (vs. desktop)</li>
			<li>Exploring low-effort ways to provide customer with an answer (i.e., using camera to scan green card)</li>
			<li>Grouping options into categories up front a la “Turbo Tax” </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">			
			We then formed subteams to develop storyboards that incorporated the above ideas. We voted on elements that resonated with each of us:
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Focused: One question at a time; very low cognitive effort</li>
			<li>Provide a sense of timeline and journey</li>
			<li>Camera capture for input (How do we reduce/eliminate the customer’s burden to supply information?)</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Journey Map</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
		We continued to gain a better understanding of what the user has to experience by facilitating a Journey Map activity. The team brainstormed on different steps involved in the naturalization process, and created the following journey map. The goal of understanding the user journey is to help applicants know what to expect. How might we give them a personalized experience of their journey?

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Eligibility tool</h2>
		<!-- research -->
		<h3 class="portfolioh3">Research</h3>
		<p class="portfoliop">The second problem we focused on was developing the eligibility tool. We asked a series of questions:</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">Why Eligibility Tool?
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Eligibility Tool exists because research (interviews) reveals one big challenge is that people often pick the wrong basis (if at all), then USCIS has to determine the applicant's eligibility. </li>
			<li>How can we use the eligibility tool to help the user? Can we use the eligibility tool outside the form to keep them separated so the tool does not need to be updated?</li>
			<li>It is important to determine the eligibility basis because the cost and waiting time could be different.</li>
			<li>People often have to hire a representative because they do not understand how they are eligible. </li>
			<li>The most serious problem is that applicants often think they are eligible, but in reality they are not.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">To begin tackling the eligibility tool concept, we need to determine: </p>
			<ul class="list">
			<li>Is an eligibility tool the right tool?</li>
			<li>Another form perhaps would be a better solution to inform the applicants of their eligibility?</li>
			<li>What is the solution?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">We also brainstormed on the criteria of the eligibility tool:
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Enable users to get to the answer as easily as possible</li>
				<li>Answering why: some context around how we determined the applicant's eligibility</li>
				<li>Trustworthy, reliable</li>
				<li>Low english proficiency</li>
				<li>Use appropriate icons/visuals to convey message</li>
				<li>Acknowledge multiple paths one user may have</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>

	<!-- Wireframes -->

	<div class="body">
		<p class="portfolioh3">Wireframes</p>
		<p class="portfoliopless">My team created three wireframes based on the ideas generated during the ideating phase:</p></p>

We were grouped into three subteams to conduct a one-week long usability testing at different locations of the USCIS field office, including San Francisco, Chicago, and New York City. I went with the team to the field office in New York City. The subteams at three locations had virtual meeting everyday to debrief on the usability testing.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">During the usability testing, We received some positive feedback and observed potential issues. Some participants expressed their excitement upon hearing about digitizing the N-400 form and revamp the entire naturalization experience.</p>

	<div class="body">
		<p class="portfoliop">
		We conducted 44 moderated usability testing at three USCIS field offices. The sessions lasted 15-30 minutes and each participant completed one of the planned activities. We tested the prototypes of eligibility tool and N-400 form. The main goal of the usability testing is to ensure that the main navigation design and new UI patterns are usable and effective. The treejack testing is to ensure that the organization of the N-400 makes sense to end users when a UI isn’t being evaluated at the same time. The team used the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/" target="_blank">Nielsen Normon Group rating metrics</a> to evaluate designs we had completed.</p>

		<h3 class="portfolioh3"> Sample results and recommendations:</h3>

		<p class="portfoliopless"><u>Eligibility tool (rating 4):</u> <br>Users moved through the Eligibility tool quickly and seemed to find it useful. The interface for the Eligibility Tool is so simple that users quickly move through it, which can lead to not noticing when they could/should make multiple selections on a single screen.</p>
		<p class="portfoliopless">Recommendation: Increase the number of yes/no questions, rather than asking multiple questions on one page through multi-select options. This will not increase the overall time to complete by much, and should help ensure that users provide the right answers to all eligibility questions.
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
		<u>Evidence (rating 4):</u> <br>Some users pressed "Save" evidence; others did not expect to click another button after uploading the file. Some participants assumed that once something was uploaded it was automatically saved to the application and did not require additional action on their part.</p>
		<p class="portfoliopless">Recommendation: Autosave documents as soon as they are uploaded, and clarify button language to clarify what it does (i.e. Close ).</p>

When asked how they would respond to the warning about incompleteness, several participants said they would edit their existing entries, but did not seem to see adding a new entry as an option for addressing the issue.
		<p class="portfoliopless">Recommendation: When we need to warn users about incomplete history, the "Add" button should not be visually separated from the warning message.
