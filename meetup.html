	<!-- Problem Context -->
		
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Problem Context</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
					
		Meetup is a useful tool to help people with similar interest who live close to one another to connect. I always use Meetup to check local events and activities I’m interested in participating. Lately, when I was using the upgraded Meetup app, I noticed some issues that might pose problems for users, and I decided to do a case study on the current app.

		<ol class="list">

		<li>Users are not able to search events on a specific date. They can only apply filter with a few options, such as “today”, “tomorrow”, “this weekend”.</li>
		<li>If someone is interested in going to an event, but could not make a final decision at the moment, Meetup app does not offer an option for user to keep the event in the “interested” list.</li>
		</ol>
 
		</p>

	<!-- Hypothesis -->

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Hypothesis</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			<ol class="list">
				<li>My hypothesis is that if users are able to explore events on a specific date, it may provide some events with more exposure and in turn increase the likelihood for the user to attend these events.</li>
				<li>If Meetup offers an option for users to save events they are interested in, it may encourage the user to check on the saved events at a later time, and result in higher attendance of the event.</li>
				</ol>
		</p>
	</div>

	<!-- User research -->

	<div class="body">	
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">User research</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		I conducted 8 interviews and summarized several key findings:
		<ol class="list">
		<li>While some users use the web-based Meetup tool, a lot of users think that a mobile app version is more convenient.</li>
		<li>Some participants mentioned about wanting a feature that allow them to select a specific date to explore events near them.</li>
		<li>One participant mentioned that she was not able to share a specific event easily with a friend within Meetup app.</li>
		<li>Some users mentioned that they must pick a category first in order to explore upcoming events. They cannot explore all kinds of events on a specific date. </li>
		</ol>
		</p>

	<!-- Market research -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Market research</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
		Before dive into the problem space, I did a research on comparable products on the market. I took a close look at Eventbrite and Facebook events. Like Meetup, Eventbrite does not offer users an option to explore events on a specific date. The available timeframe is general, such as “this weekend” or “next weekend”. However, Eventbrite does offer a feature for users to save events that they are interested in, and compile them in one place where users can easily access. </p>

	<div class="aboutme">

	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<p class="portfoliop">Facebook’s event app offers an option for user to indicate interest on an event, and it also allows the user to choose a specific date to search events. However, it does not offer a place for user to see all the events he/she is interested in. The only place to find the events is the calendar page where all the events are listed with all the birthdays of users’ friends. This form of presentation can be confusing and overwhelming.

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Identifying the people problem</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		Users want to be able to filter events by specific date so that they can plan future activities ahead of time. They also want an option to save events that seem interesting and access them easily. 
		</p>
	</div>


	<!-- Opportunities -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Opportunities (How Might We ...)</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		After exploring the problem space, I identified two opportunities to improve the Meetup features:
		<ol class="list">
		<li>How might we provide users with more flexibility on selecting a timeframe to explore events?</li>
		<li>How might we enable users to easily find a list of events that he/she is interested in attending?</li>
		</p>

	<!-- Persona -->

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Persona</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">After the research on users, I created a persona for the primary uses who are the ones would gain the most value from the new design. I would be designing the new features with these user groups in mind.

	<!-- Brainstorming -->

	<div class="body">

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Brainstorming</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">After the ideation session, I categorized the post-it notes into different groups, which are essentially themes or logical groupings of the brainstorm ideas. From the aggregation, I picked two features by analyzing the tradeoffs. For instance, does the feature conflict with a business goal, or are some features more impactful? The first feature is to add a date selection function, and the second feature is to add an option to save interested events.</p>

			Within each of the identified feature spaces, I created an idea using <em>shorthand user flow diagrams</em>. The goal is to synthesize the ideas and prioritize by what is doable, meaningful, and have the most potential for impact.
