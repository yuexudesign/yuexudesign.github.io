		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Data Description</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">Have you ever wondered why animals become endangered or extinct? The rapid loss of species in today's world is estimated by experts to be between <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/biodiversity/biodiversity/" target="_blank">1,000 and 10,000 times higher </a>than the natural extinction rate. Inspired by book <i>The Sixth Extinction,</i> this project is intended to explore the correlation between the growth of human population and extinction of animal species. We used several datasets for this visualization: population data from 1500 to 1950 by continent (created from Wikipedia), population data from 1960 to 2010 by country (from Kaggle), animal extinction data by time and country (created from Wikipedia), coordinates for all countries (from <a href="https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv</a>) , IUCN red list (from IUCN API), and json file for map with continent information (<a href="https://github.com/robereng/d3-map-zoom/find/gh-pages" target="_blank">https://github.com/robereng/d3-map-zoom/find/gh-pages</a>).</p>

		
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Mapping from data to visual elements</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">Users can interact with the slider to explore the data within a specific period of time. The size of circle indicates the total number of animal extinctions. On hover, each circle also shows the name of the country. When clicked, the list of extinct animals in that country (within selected time frame/selected class) will show on full screen. We specifically chose to present the list this way to encourage user taking a close look at the list of the extinct animals. The red background is to make an impact and remind user that these species are forever gone.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">We used one donut chart to indicate the proportion of animals at risk to the entire animal population to provide the user with a bigger picture. The second donut chart indicates the proportion of six categories under the IUCN Red List of animals at risk in detail. We mapped the chosen colors to the corresponding category to represent the severity of species endangerment. The hover of each category on the donut chart shows the definition of the category as well as the total number of animals under that category.</p>

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">The story</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">After we mapped all the data on the world map and the time slider, we have found a strong correlation between the world population and the number of extinct animals. As the human population grew faster in the last few centuries, the number of extinct animals also grew much larger.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">Two dramatic changes occur from 1800 to 1900, and from 1900 to 1950. As we expand the time range from 1800 to 1900, there are many more red dots appearing on the map, which indicating there are many more extinct animals around the world. Our assumption for this phenomenon is that the industrial revolution took place from late 1700s to early 1800s. The advancement of technology may have exacerbated environmental pollution and accelerated the rate of animal extinction.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">The other noticeable incident occurrs from 1900 to 1950. The number of extinct animals in several countries become observably larger.  We also noticed that the population of some countries become much denser during the period of 1950 to 1960. Our assumption is that penicillin was discovered in 1928. The prevalence of penicillin helped prevent millions of premature deaths, which resulted faster population growth.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">After 1800, thousands of people started to immigrate to Australia, the United States and New Zealand. That may explain the rapid growth of animal extinction in the 19th century in those countries. Our assumption is that new immigrants may have introduced new bacteria and virus that led the death of many animals. Because most of the extinct animals in Australia are mammals and birds, our other assumption is that when the new immigrants first came to Australia, they hunted extensively and may have caused the extinction of those animals.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">What surprised us was that extinction did not increase very noticeably since 1980s. One assumption is that humans increasingly realized the toll they are putting on nature, and therefore applied more efforts to conserve species; another is that a lot of species remain categorized “critically endangered” instead of “extinct” by IUCN because of the lack of information in recent years. In reality, a lot of them might already have been extinct, just not confirmed by officials.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">Other than human population, a lot of other changes in environment such as global warming, could also be used to explain the accelerated (almost mass) extinction of species. Because most of them are human induced, we feel like our selections of data is a powerful representation of the relationship between human population growth and animal extinction/endangerment rate.
