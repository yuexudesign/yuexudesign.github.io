		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Problem Statement</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
					
		A majority of Choice Hotels .com audience lands on the Property Page(s) either by going directly to the ChoiceHotels.com website, paid, organic, or other sources.  Unfortunately, a large percentage of this audiences leaves the page without booking a room.  How should we improve conversion from a UX/UI standpoint using knowledge of discovery and design?

			To better understand the problem space from an overview perspective, I want to first research on the analytics of Choice Hotels. I want to find out about the website drop off rate, and on which page(s) do most drop off occur. Since I don't have access to the details of Google Analytics for Choice Hotels, I used some data provided by SimilarWeb and gained some initial insights.

	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		I compared some quantative data of Choice Hotels with Marriott, Hilton, and Wyndham, and summarized several key findings:
		<ol class="list">
		<li>The bounce rate of Choice Hotel is about 10%–20% higher than Marriott and Hilton.</li>
		<li>The average visit duration for Choice Hotels is shorter than Marriott and Hilton, which also corresponds to its higher bounce rate.</li>
		<li>The pages per visit for Choice Hotels is smaller than Hilton and Marriott.</li>
		<!-- <li>The pages per visit for Choice Hotels (3.61) which may imply a lot of users are close to check out but decided to drop off.</li> -->
		</ol>
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">To understand whether the different of bounce rate amongst these hotels has any significance, I consulted with a research scientist who helped me determine the <em>p value</em> of the bounce rate to find out if the difference amongst the bounce rates has any meaning.</p>

		<p class="portfoliop">Since the <em>p value</em> is much smaller than 0.05, the difference of bounce rate between Choice Hotels and other hotels has a significant meaning.</p>

	<!-- Competitive analysis -->
	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Competitive analysis</h2>
		<p class="portfoliop">
		Because the bounce rate of Choice Hotels' competitors is lower, and the number is statistically meaningful, this indicates that we can learn from the competitors and minimize our bounce rate. I wanted to learn more about Choice Hotels' competitors who have a lower bounce rate, so I carefully studied the reservation experience on both Marriott and Hilton's websites. After conducted a competitive analysis, I created a SWOT chart to identify our weaknesses and opportunites.</p>

	<!-- Journey map -->

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Journey Map</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		To better understand the needs and pain points of the user, I interviewed one user who is a self-identified occasional traveler, and recorded the steps in his experience of using Choice Hotel website to make a reservation. 
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="aboutme">
		<a href="img/choice-journey-map.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="fullbleedbody" src="img/choice-journey-map.jpg"></a>

	<!-- User research -->

	<div class="body">	
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">User research</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		If time and resources allow, I would conduct research on different user groups, such as frequent travelers, occasional travelers, and meeting planers who frequently make group reservation. Because of time constraint, I conducted 5 interviews on occasional travelers and frequent travelers from various demographics, and summarized some key findings.</p>
		<p class="portfoliopless">Top priorities travelers consider when booking a hotel:
		<ol class="list">
		<li>Price</li>
		<li>Review</li>
		<li>Location (distance to final destination)</li>
		<li>Safety</li>
		<li>Public transportation</li>
		<li>Facilities</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<p class="portfoliopless">Then, I designed a few tasks for users to complete to discover potential usability issues on the existing website. I noted a few repeated issues:</p>
		<ul class="list">
		<li>Top selection tool (room, adult, child) takes up too much space, and it's not particularly helpful because user already made the selection on the previous page.</li>
		<li>Some users did not see the tabs ("pay now", "pay at check-in", "packages").</li>
		<li>"Member price" and "non-member price" caused a lot confusion and suspicion. Lowest rates are reflected on the tabs ("pay now", "pay at check-in", "packages"). However, when users clicked into the tab and saw that the lower rate is for member, they felt that they've been tricked because most of them are reluctant to sign up for the membership.</li>
		<li>"Member price" and "non-member price" land on the same page. Either the two CTA should take user to different sign-in/reservation pages, or the member login form should be on the same page as the non-member reservation page.</li>
		<li>Details of review is not obvious, but review is a priority for user to consider when booking a hotel.</li>
		<li>Map does not include public transportation info. Public transportation is also something user thinks about when booking a hotel. Therefore, map similar to Google Maps API where users can find public transportation info would be helpful.</li>
		<li>"Packages" tab caused a lot of confusion. Users did not understand why the price is more expensive than the other two options, and they could not locate any additional info on this option.</li>
		<li>Users did not see "lowest price gurantee". Price is a top priority for a lot of travelers, so this graphic on the website could be more prominent. Content on top left is more memberable than content on the right side bar on a webpage. Therefore, possibly consider moving the "lowest price gurantee" graphic to top left.</li>
		<li>Users want to see more images on details of the hotel room.</li>
		<li>The daily parking fee turned some users off.</li>
		<li>Users don't have any indication of the progress on the check-out experience.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

	<div class="body">

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Brainstorming</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">I had a ideation session, and brainstormed on different potential ways to improve the usability of the website. I categorized the post-it notes into different groups, which are essentially themes or logical groupings of the brainstorm ideas. From the aggregation, I picked a few features to further explore.</p>

		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Preliminary sketches</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			I quickly sketched out the features I want to test for the website. </p>
		
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			<ol class="list">
				<li>The first feature is moving the search options to the right sidebar to save some space above the fold, and adding sort and filter underneath the search options. Another idea for the search options is that instead of always show search options, the search options would collapse once the initial search is done, but the user can still expand the options by simply clicking the "modify search" button. </li>
				<li>The second feature is adding a progress bar on top of the webpage to set a expectation for the user on steps involved in the check-out process. </li>
				<li>The third feature is moving the tab options "pay now", "pay at check-in", and "packages" to the main content so that user can quickly scan all prices immediately, not just the misleading "member price". </li>
				<li>The last feature is to add the member login form on the same page with the guest check-out form.</li>

			I experiemented the new design in the following 3 ways:</p>

					<li>Collapse search options into a "modify search" button to save some space above the fold.</li>
					<li>Moved the price options on the tabs under each room because some users missed the tabs options entirely. In addition, some users want to check and compare all price options at a single glance instead of clicking into a price tab only to find out the price on tab reflects member's rate.</li>

	<!-- testing -->

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Testing</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			Because it's a time-boxed design challenge, I did not have time to conduct a usability testing on the newly created designs. If I had time to test the designs, I would create a few tasks for users to complete. By measuring certain metrics, such as time required to complete task and the success rate, I would get some initial insights on how successful the designs are. I would also collect emotion data when users interact with the new designs, whether they are frustrated or satisfied with the experience, and where do they get stuck. Moreover, I would study Google Analytics data and see if the bounce rate and drop-off rate have improved.
