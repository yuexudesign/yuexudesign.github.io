	<!-- Problem statement -->
		
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Problem Statement</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		By mid 2017, LinkedIn has over <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/24/linkedin-users/" target="_blank"> 500 million users</a>.<sup>1</sup> LinkedIn use the power of professional networking and profile data to connect individuals with relevant opportunities for professional growth, development, and career opportunities. However, sometimes when members are happy in their current positions, they become dormant users and choose not to spend their time on LinkedIn. </p>
		
		<p class="portfoliopless"> The challenge of this design exercise is to design a welcome back experience for a dormant user who is returning after 3+ months. The goal is to find a creative solution that gains the dormant user’s attention, and encourage users to actively participate on LinkedIn frequently.</p>

		To better understand the problem space from an overview perspective, I researched on some analytics of LinkedIn.
		</p>
		<p class="portfoliopless">According to an article by Fortune, <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/24/linkedin-users/" target="_blank">Apptopia</a>, a Boston company that tracks usage of web properties, estimates LinkedIn had about 227 million monthly active users (or people who log in at least once a month) in January, 2017. That number grew to 240 million in February, and 260 million in March. As of April 2017, LinkedIn has seen about 252 million active users.<sup>1</sup></p>

		After studying some quantitative data and articles on LinkedIn, I summarized several key findings:
		<ul class="list">
			<li>U.S. users accounts for a large portion LinkedIn traffic.</li>
			<li>There is a tremendous potential of conversion by reaching out to the millennials. </li>
			<li>There is a steady growth of LinkedIn users since 2009.</li>
			<li>The Talent Solutions accounts for a large portion of revenue for LinkedIn. The needs and experience for regular professional users and recruiters vary greatly, therefore, for the scope of this design exercise, I decided to focus on the regular professional users.</li>

	<!-- Hypothesis -->

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Hypothesis</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="body">
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			After the preliminary research, I brainstormed on potential causes of inactive LinkedIn users and wanted to validate these assumptions by conducting further research on the users.
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Already have a good job, not actively seeking new opportunities</li>
				<!-- <li>Find content on LinkedIn is not very relevant</li> -->
				<li>Not aware or unfamiliar with LinkedIn’s features, such as Slideshare, Salary, etc.</li>
				<li>Spend more time on other social media so that has less time to use LinkedIn</li>
				<li>Concerns with privacy issues</li>

	<!-- User research -->

	<div class="body">	
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">User research</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
		I conducted user research on 24 participants, including 8 in-person interviews and 16 surveys on users from different demographics (different ethnicities, and age range from 20s to 60s). They also have various professional background, ranging from research scientists to business analysts. By conducting the in-depth user research, I was able to validate some hypothesis and also encountered some surprises and insights.</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Some competitors where mentioned multiple times during the user research, including Indeed, Glassdoor, and Monster.</li>
			<li>Key features users use: search profile of a person or a company, connect with colleagues/friends, job hunting, self-branding.</li>
			<li>Most people only use LinkedIn when they are actively looking for new opportunities.</li>
			<li>Some users think there is excess branding (both for individual and company) on LinkedIn, therefore, they are not sure if all the information is reliable.</li>
			<li>Some users use both web and mobile version of LinkedIn, but more people use the web version.</li>
			<li>Users enjoy the features of connection, seeing common connections, and job recommendation the most.</li>
			<li>Users spend more time on other social media so that the time spent on LinkedIn daily is relatively short.</li>
			<li>Many users were not aware of the lesser-known features of LinkedIn, such as Salary, Learning, and Slideshare.</li>
			<li>Some users found that the content on LinkedIn is not relevant or useful.</li>
			<li>Some users are not active on social media platforms in general.</li>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
			After the initial research, I brainstormed on strategies to encourage users to engage and interact more with LinkedIn. From the idea aggregation, I picked a few features to further explore.
			<ol class="list">
				<li>Although the content in news feed is already personalized, to address the issue of multiple users' feedback on receiving content and news feed that are not very relevant, LinkedIn can further employ AI/machine learning to <b>tailor the content even more to users' interest</b> and design a more <b>personalized experience</b>. </li>
				<li>Based on the user research, several users indicated excessive branding for both individuals and companies. LinkedIn may <b>establish trust and transparency</b> between user and product as well as expand and explore new feature for the product by allowing users to provide company reviews anonymously.</li>
				<li>A majority of users only use LinkedIn when they are actively job hunting. Some are not active on social media platforms, and they think LinkedIn is just another social media platform for job hunting and expanding professional network. However, LinkedIn is much more than "just another social media". Many users are not fully aware of the invaluable resources LinkedIn has, such as Slideshare, Learnings, and Salary. Because users lack awareness of the lesser-known LinkedIn features, they do not realize the considerable potential LinkedIn has. One user even suggested LinkedIn to have a salary feature. By <b>promoting the lesser-known useful features</b> within LinkedIn, it may encourage users to engage more with the product.</li>

		<p class="portfoliopless">
			I conducted 3 sessions of usability testing on the low-fi prototypes, and found a few problems that I want to address for my next iteration.
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Instead of using "personalized news", I need to consider another term. A user indicated privacy concerns when he saw "personalized." He felt all his actions have been closely monitored by the website.</li>
				<li>The sequence of the promoted product features plays an important role to attract user's attention.</li>
				<li>Besides the close icon, I need to add a "Home" button to take user back to the homepage easily.</li>

	<div class="body">
		<h2 class="portfolioh2">Moving forward</h2>
		<p class="portfoliopless">
			Because it's a time-boxed design exercise, I only had time to conduct limited usability testing on the design. However, the design exercise does not end here. Moving forward, I would conduct another round of usability testing on the high-fidelity prototype. By iterating the design based on the data collected during usability testing, I intend to achieve the ultimate project goal to promote frequent engagement between users and LinkedIn products.
